This extension adds the check number field to the payment table and 
changes the logic to return to the "Invoices" screen rather than the
"Payments" screen after a payment is posted.

After this extension is enabled, the first time you access a payment
screen the new "ac_check_number" field will be added to the payment
table. If there is a check number in the "ac_notes" field, it will be
moved to the new "ac_check_number" field. Check numbers in the notes
field must be at the front of the notes field. It can begin with a
hashtag, "#", or not.
