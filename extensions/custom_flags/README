Add the custom flags feature to Simple Invoices.
This will add the "Custom Flags" menu option to the Settings.
The first time this menu option is selected, a new database table,
si_custom_flags, will be created and populated. Also, a new field,
custom_flags, will be added to the tables that can have custom flags
set. Currently only the products table (si_products) can have custom
flags. A maximum of 10 custom flags can be defined for a table. Once
the tables have been created/updated, the new, si_custom_flags table
will be populated. The Settings/Custom Flags option will allow you to
enter information for each flag you wish to define and to enable them.
Once enabled, the flag option will appear in the maintenance screen for
the tables that support them (aka Products).

NOTE: To enable the "field_help" feature, the "documentation" enhancement
extension needs to be enabled.
