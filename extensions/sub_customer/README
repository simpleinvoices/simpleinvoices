Sub-customer extensions
=======

This allows you to have parent and child customers

When you create an invoice you select which parent company to invoice - then a drop down list will appear to enable the selection of child company

You can also use this have various 'locations' for one customer - the invoice template can be adjsuted to print the sub customer info on it for whatever purposes you want

run the sql in ./database/changes

Invoice.custom_field1 is used to store the sub customer ID in the invoice

The install of this extension will cause changes to the customers table and hence all inserts / updates will have to address all relevent fields fully.

It may be considered experimental as it was done for a specific client of the lead developer and not updated thereafter.
