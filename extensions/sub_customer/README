Sub-customer extensions
=======

This allows you to have parent and child customers

When you create an invoice you select which parent company to invoice.
Then a drop down list will appear to enable the selection of child company

You can also use this to have various 'locations' for one customer.
The invoice template can be adjsuted to print the sub customer info on it
for whatever purposes you want

A new field, parent_customer_id, will be added to the si_customers table
automatically after this extension is enabled and you perform the first
customer lookup.
