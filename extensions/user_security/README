Adds company_name_item, session_timeout and password constraint variables
to si_system_defaults table, adds username to the si_user table, and
defines altername help icons for all templates.

The username will be initialized to the email setting for the user
thus preserving the existing log on identity for all users. However,
the new logic allows a user to have a username that does not have
to be in the form of an email address. This change also eliminates
the unique composite index, UnqEMailPwd, which would prevent an
email with the same password for another user. This has no value and
could in some cases contribute to password discovery.

The company_name_item allows the user to change the labeling on the
logon screen to show a company name rather than the default
SimpleInvoices value.

The session_timeout allows a user specified value to control the
elapsed time before an inactive user session times out. The default
timeout period will be set to 15 minutes. As long as users make entries
within this limit, their session timeout interval will be renewed to
another 15 minutes. If the default is not sufficient, you can change it
to any value from 10 to 999 minutes.

The password constraint fields are set to require a password minimum
length of 8 characters and that a password begin with an alpha character,
contain one uppercase, one lowercase, one numeric and one special
character. These constraints can be changed via the System Preferences
screen with the exception that the minimum password length cannot be
less than 6-characters and must begin with an alpha character.

The images for the item level help, both regular and required are
changed to be less prominent than the historic images.
