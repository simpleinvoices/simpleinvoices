## Known Issues
* **Heart Internet Users** -- There is currently an issue with exporting invoices to PDF. Images are not currently being rendered in the PDF. We are working on resolving this issue but unfortunately we do not yet have a fix. We recommend that you use a different hosting service if you need to export PDF invoices.
