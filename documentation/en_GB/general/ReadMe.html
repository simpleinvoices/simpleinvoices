	<ul>
		<li>Requirements:
		<ul>
			<li>Apache 
			<li>MySQL
			<li>PHP 5
				<ul>
					<li>For PDF export to work your PHP needs:
						<ul>
							<li>GD2 support
							<li>php.ini needs to be edited with a max memory of 24M
						</ul>
					<li>For Reports to work your PHP needs:
						<ul>
							<li>xsl support (in PHP5)
						</ul>
				</ul>
			<li>The cache/ directory in the Simple Invoices folder must be writeable by the webserver user (ie chown apache:apache cache)  
		</ul>
	</ul>
	<ul>
		<li>Recommended:
		<ul><li>phpMyAdmin <a href="http://phpmyadmin.sf.net">http://phpmyadmin.sf.net</a>
		</ul>
	</ul>
	<ul>
		<li>Dont have the above installed?
		<ul>
			<li>Windows: The easiest way to install all the required software on Windows is to download and install the WAMP5 package from <a href="http://www.wampserver.com/en">http://www.wampserver.com/en</a> .WAMP is Apache, MySQL, PHP for Windows in one easy to install file
			<li>Mac: The easiest way to install all the required software on Mac is to download and install the MAMP5 package from <a href="http://www.mamp.info/">http://www.mamp.info/</a> .MAMP is Apache, MySQL, PHP for Mac in one easy to install file
			<li>Linux: just do the usual per your distribution to install the required softwares
		</ul>
	</ul>
	<ul>
		<li>Installation on Simple Invoices
		<ul>
			<li>Now the required software has been installed and is running, download the latest Simple Invoices package from htt://simpleinvoices.sf.net
			<li>Extract the contents of the simple_invoices_yyyymmdd.zip to a simpleinvoices folder in your web servers document root (ie. /var/www in Debian)
			<li>Create a simple_invoices database on your database server.  I recommend you use phpMyAdmin to create/manage your new database.
			<li>Once this database has been created populate the database with tables and test data by running the SimpleInvoicesDatabase.sql file in your database
			<ul><li>In phpMyAdmin open the simple_invoices database you just created and go to the SQL tab
				<li>Upload the file in the SimpleInvoicesDatabase.sql "Location of the textfile:" and click go
				<li>Note: MySQL 4.0 user, please us the SimpleInvoicesDatabase-MySQL4_0.sql file instead of SimpleInvoicesDatabase.sql
				<li>Note: SimpleInvoicesDatabase.sql works fine with MySQL 4.1 and above.
			</ul>
			<li>Now the database has data and files have been 'installed' in the webservers document root, SimpleInvoice just need to have its configuration file edited and then its fine to use
			<ul><li>Open the Simple Invoices coniguration file (which is config.php in the config/ folder) up in your favourite text editor
			<li>Edit the file so that 
			<ul><li>$db_host equals the name of your database server (normally "localhost"), 
			<li>$db_name to the name of the database (normally "simple_invoices"), 
			<li>$db_user to the database username for the database specified in $db_name,
			<li>$db_password to the password of the database user
			<li>Set the cache directory as writeable.  To do this cd to the Simple Invoices directory (<i>cd /var/www/html/simpleinvoices</i>) and chown the cache directory to the apache(web server) user (<i>chown apache:apache cache</i>) or if your lazy just chmod 777 the directory (<i>chmod -Rv 777 cache*</i>)
			</ul>
		</ul>
		<li>The base of Simple invoices has been setup now, there are a couple of changes that need to be made on your system to enable Export to PDF and Simple Invoices database backup 
			<ul>
				<li><a name="pdf">Export to PDF</a>
				<ul>
					<li>For 'Export to PDF' to work there are two modifcation that needs to be made to your system:
					<li>The first step is to make the pdf exports directory writeable by the webserver
						<ul>
							<li>To do this the cachce directory in your Simple Invoices folder must be writeable, in unix cd to the Simple Invoices directory (<i>cd /var/www/html/simpleinvoices</i>) and chown the cache directory to the apache (webserver user) (<i>chown apache:apache cache</i>), in windows just browse to the cache folder and make sure its writeable by all users.
                                                        <li>We also need to make the pdf fonts directory writeable. To do this in unix chown the pdf/fpdf directory to the apache(web server) user (<i>chmown apache:apache pdf/fpdf/*</i>), in windows just browse to the fdpf folder(in the pdf folder) and make sure its writeable by all users.
						</ul>
					<li><i>gd2</i> Once this cache folder has been made writeable the next step is to test if version of PHP has GD2 support
						<ul>
							<li>GD2 is an extension to PHP which enables PHP to create and manipulate image files in a variety of different image formats
							<li>To test if your version of PHP has GD2 support open up your internet browser and browse inside Siple Invoice folder to the <a href="phpinfo.php">phpinfo.php</a> file (<i>http://localhost/simpleinvoices/phpinfo.php</i>)
							<li>Once phpinfo.php isopen in your browser, scroll down to the 'gd' section and check the values for 'GD Support' and 'GD Version'. If all goes well you should see similar information to below
<pre>
	gd
GD Support 	enabled
GD Version 	2.0 or higher
</pre>	
							<li>If your PHP doesnt have GD2 support enabled or doesnt have GD2 or above please refer to your operating systems PHP guide on how to enable this. In Debain/Ubuntu just install the <i>php-gd</i> package through 'Add Applications' to get gd support
						</ul>						
					<li>Once you have confirmed your PHP has GD2 support we must test if your php.ini file needs to be altered to enable pdf creation
						<ul>
							<li>To test if you need to modify your php.ini file open your internet browser and go to your Simple Invoices directory <a href="library/pdf">pdf/</a> (<i>http://localhost/simpleinvoices/library/pdf</i>)
							<li>This page 'html2ps/pdf demo' is used to test if your system is capable of generating pdf files
							<li>The 'Source' area the 'Single URL' is set to www.google.com by default, if you are connected to the internet just leave this as is but if your currently not connected to the internet change this to a valid webpage on your system ie. <i>http://localhost/simpleinvoices</i> and scroll to the bottom of the page and click the 'Convert File' button
							<li>If all goes well a pdf of www.google.com homepage(or the valid url you entered) will be created and displayed in your pdf viewer
							<li>If a pdf wasn't created and the below error occurred this mean you will have to alter your php.ini file
							<pre>
Fatal error: Allowed memory size of 8388608 bytes exhausted (tried to allocate 4864 bytes) 
in /var/www/simpleinvoices/pdf/filter.data.html2xhtml.class.php on line 8
</pre>
						</ul>
						<li><i>php.ini</i>
						<ul>
							<li>If in the above procedure you found that a pdf cant be created and an 'Allowed memory size' error occurred you have to edit your php.ini
							<li>To find where your php.ini file is stored on the system browse again to tha <a href"phpinfo.php">phpinfo.php</a> page (<i>http://localhost/simpleinvoices/phpinfo.php</i>) and note where the  'Configuration File (php.ini) Path' is referring to.
							<li>Open the php.ini file from the location referred in the previous step in your favourite text editor (notepad,vi,emacs,gedit...) and alter the specified 'memory_limit' number
								<ul>
									<li>Find the line 'memory_limit =' (refer below) and change this from the default 8M to 24M (more if your adventurous :) ) 							 

<pre>
;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
; Resource Limits ;
;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

max_execution_time = 90     ; Maximum execution time of each script, in seconds
max_input_time = 60 ; Maximum amount of time each script may spend parsing request data
memory_limit = 8M      ; Maximum amount of memory a script may consume (8MB)
</pre>
									<li>Your altered php.ini file should now looking like below
<pre>
;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
; Resource Limits ;
;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;

max_execution_time = 90     ; Maximum execution time of each script, in seconds
max_input_time = 60 ; Maximum amount of time each script may spend parsing request data
memory_limit = 24M      ; Maximum amount of memory a script may consume (8MB)
</pre>
									<li>For this change to come into affect you need to reload apache, in red hat based systems <i>sudo /etc/init.d/httpd reload</i> or in ubuntu/debian <i>sudo /etc/init.d/apache2 reload</i>. If your unsure of this step or your a windows users just restart your system and it'll be right.
							</ul>
						</ul>
					</ul>
				</ul>
			<ul>
				<li><a name="backup">Simple invoices database backup</a>
					<ul>
                                     		 <li>For 'Simple invoices database backup' to work the first step is to make the database_backups directory(which is in the Simple Invoices directory writeable by the webserver
                                        	 <li>To do this the  in unix cd to the Simple Invoices directory (<i>cd /var/www/html/simpleinvoices</i>) and chown the database_backups directory to the apache(web server) user (<i>chown apache:apache database_backups</i>), in windows just browse to the database_backups folder and make sure its writeable by all users.
                                       </ul>

			</ul>
		<li>Everything has been setup and configured now, Simple Invoice is ready to be used
		<li>Open your Internet browser and go to http://localhost/simpleinvoices and user Simple Invoices as you wish
		<li>Installation is finished
	</ul>
	</ul>
</ul>
<a name="login"><b>Enabling the login/authentication system</b></a>
<ul>
	<li>Simple Invoices has a login system which can allow you to protect your Simple Invoices with a username and password login system.  By default this is turned off.
	<li>To turn on the login system in Simple Invoices all you have to do is
	<li>Open the config/config.php file and change the line $authentication.enabled = "false" to $authentication.enabled = "true"
	<li>Done :), now just open up Simple Invoices and it should redirect you to a login page
</ul>
<a name="upgrading"><b>Ugrading Simple Invoices from one version to another</b></a>
<ul>
	<li>To upgrade Simple Invoices from one version to another, the first step is to download the updated version of Simple Invoices from our <a href="http://www.simpleinvoices.org">website</a>
	<li>The next step is to backup (make a copy) of your config.php file which is located in the config folder
	<li>Once this file has been backed up, extract (unzip) the contents of the Simple Invoices file which you downloaded into the simpleinvoices directory in your webservers document root
	<li>open up the config.php file thats in the config directory and enter you database details (db_host, $db_name, $db_user and $db_password) into the file and save it
	<li>Now that most of the work has been done open up Simple Invoices in your browser (usually http://localhost/simpleinvoices) and from the Options menu in Simple Invoices select Database Upgrade Manager
	<ul><li>If this is the first time that the Database Upgrade Manager has run
	<ul><li> you'll be preseneted with a screen promting you to Initialise the Database Upgrade
		<li>click on the INITIALISE DATABASE UPGRADE button to start the database upgrade process
		<li>Once the Initialisation has complete you'll be prompted to go back to the Database Upgrade Manager screen from which you can run the remaining patches
		<li>Go back to the Database Upgrade Manager screen by clicking the HERE button
		<li>Once back at the Database Upgrade Manager screen it will list which of the patches have and have not been run.  If all patches say they have been applied then the upgrade process is complete and you can continue to use Simple Invoices as normal.  If it says that some pathces have not been applied click on the UPDATE button to apply the remaining patches
		<li>Once the remaining patches have been applied you'll be prompted to go back to the Database Upgrade Manager screen.  From the Database Upgrade Manager screen you'll be able to double-check that all the patches have been applied.  If they now say that they are all applied the upgrade process is complete and you can use Simple Invoices as normal
	</ul>
	<li>If the Database Manager Upgrade has been run before
		<ul>
		<li>the Database Upgrade Manager screen it will list which of the patches have and have not been run.  If all patches say they have been applied then the upgrade process is complete and you can continue to use Simple Invoices as normal.  If it says that some pathces have not been applied click on the UPDATE button to apply the remaining patches
		<li>Once the remaining patches have been applied you'll be prompted to go back to the Database Upgrade Manager screen.  From the Database Upgrade Manager screen you'll be able to double-check that all the patches have been applied.  If they now say that they are all applied the upgrade process is complete and you can use Simple Invoices as normal
		</ul>
	</ul>
</ul>
<a name="prepare"><b>Preparing Simple Invoices for use</b></a>
<ul>
	<li>The first steps in using Simple Invoices is to setup the base information, that is billers, customers, products, tax rates, and invoice preferences
</ul>
	<ul>
		<li>Add biller
			<ul>

	<li><b>The basics</b>
	<br>
	<br>
	<ul>
	<li>Now that Simple Invoices has been installed and setup will all the required information, you can start to do some invoices :)
	<li>Open Simple Invoices in your browser (http://localhost/simpleinvoices)
	<li>To create an invoice, in the main page click on the style of invoice you wish to create, Invoice - Total or Invoice - Itemised
	<ul>
		<li>A Total Invoice is an invoice that - think an invoice from a plumber that lists the actions and then has one price and the tax assocaited 
		<li>An Itemised Invoice is an invoice that list many different items in the same invoice - think a grocery store invoice	
		<li>A Consulting Invoice is an invoice that is similar to the intemised style except that with each line item there is a detail description of the work performed/product sold - think accounting/legal firms invoices	
	</ul>
	<li>Once in the create invoice screen, select a biller, select a customer.
