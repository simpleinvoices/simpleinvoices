 *  VERION HISTORY:
 *      v1.3.0 [10.10.2005] - Fixed it so that single quotes are handled the 
 *                            right way rather than simple stripping them.  This
 *                            was needed because the user could still put in
 *                            quotes.
 *  
 *      v1.2.1 [06.05.2005] - Fixed typo from previous fix :)
 *
 *      v1.2.0 [05.31.2005] - Added the optional ability to remove all quotes
 *                            from the paypal posts.  The IPN will come back
 *                            invalid sometimes when quotes are used in certian
 *                            fields.
 *
 *      v1.1.0 [05.15.2005] - Revised the form output in the submit_paypal_post
 *                            method to allow non-javascript capable browsers
 *                            to provide a means of manual form submission.
 *
 *      v1.0.0 [04.16.2005] - Initial Version
 *
 *******************************************************************************
 *  DESCRIPTION:
 *
 *      NOTE: See www.micahcarrick.com for the most recent version of this class
 *            along with any applicable sample files and other documentaion.
 *
 *      This file provides a neat and simple method to interface with paypal and
 *      The paypal Instant Payment Notification (IPN) interface.  This file is
 *      NOT intended to make the paypal integration "plug 'n' play". It still
 *      requires the developer (that should be you) to understand the paypal
 *      process and know the variables you want/need to pass to paypal to
 *      achieve what you want.  
 *
 *      This class handles the submission of an order to paypal aswell as the
 *      processing an Instant Payment Notification.
 *  
 *      This code is based on that of the php-toolkit from paypal.  I've taken
 *      the basic principals and put it in to a class so that it is a little
 *      easier--at least for me--to use.  The php-toolkit can be downloaded from
 *      http://sourceforge.net/projects/paypal.
 *      
 *      To submit an order to paypal, have your order form POST to a file with:
 *
 *          $p = new paypal_class;
 *          $p->add_field('business', 'somebody@domain.com');
 *          $p->add_field('first_name', $_POST['first_name']);
 *          ... (add all your fields in the same manor)
 *          $p->submit_paypal_post();
 *
 *      To process an IPN, have your IPN processing file contain:
 *
 *          $p = new paypal_class;
 *          if ($p->validate_ipn()) {
 *          ... (IPN is verified.  Details are in the ipn_data() array)
 *          }
 *
 *
 *      In case you are new to paypal, here is some information to help you:
 *
 *      1. Download and read the Merchant User Manual and Integration Guide from
 *         http://www.paypal.com/en_US/pdf/integration_guide.pdf.  This gives 
 *         you all the information you need including the fields you can pass to
 *         paypal (using add_field() with this class) aswell as all the fields
 *         that are returned in an IPN post (stored in the ipn_data() array in
 *         this class).  It also diagrams the entire transaction process.
 *
 *      2. Create a "sandbox" account for a buyer and a seller.  This is just
 *         a test account(s) that allow you to test your site from both the 
 *         seller and buyer perspective.  The instructions for this is available
 *         at https://developer.paypal.com/ as well as a great forum where you
 *         can ask all your paypal integration questions.  Make sure you follow
 *         all the directions in setting up a sandbox test environment, including
 *         the addition of fake bank accounts and credit cards.
